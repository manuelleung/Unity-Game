Simple idea for the game could be a sidescroller with obstacles where the character is moving at all times. The player can only press the whole screen as 1 button to switch the player from down gravity to up gravity to avoid the obstacles. When down gravity, the character runs on the ground, when up gravity the character runs on the ceiling. If character hits an obstacle (spikes) it dies and starts from start, other obstacles can be holes, walls, etc.

Will think of more. If you think of seomething add your ideas here.
