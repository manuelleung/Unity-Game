Simple idea for the game could be a sidescroller with obstacles where the character is moving at all times. The player can only press the whole screen as 1 button to switch the player from down gravity to up gravity to avoid the obstacles. When down gravity, the character runs on the ground, when up gravity the character runs on the ceiling. If character hits an obstacle (spikes) it dies and starts from start, other obstacles can be holes, walls, etc.

Will think of more. If you think of seomething add your ideas here.

## Types of Obstacles
1. Item
    - Things that are placed accordingly in the area. Causes: Slow and Fast, affecting the movement of the player.
2. Walls
    - some walls can be broken (breakable walls) and some are not.
3. Switches
    - causes changes in the gravity speed.


## Game Design
1. Sample use of switches
    - since the player is constantly moving, the switches and items should be placed where the area gets harder (more obstacles) so it makes the area easier (for more obstacles, a slow item will help the player avoid the incoming obstacles) and will only make the area more difficult if the player that miss the item before going towards the harder area.
